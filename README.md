# Hello, it's me! I'm the problem. lol

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I realized, this profile has no README (not that I have a decent one on my main profile, lol), but i guess this one will do for the timebeing. 

This profile was supposed to be my university profile, but i drifted away from it. Now, I decided to dump my random (and probably crazy) projects here.
